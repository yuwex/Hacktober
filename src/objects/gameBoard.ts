// this is to help structure our game and allow for multiple lanes

// create instances of Lanes so that we can have multiple
// have central things like score and song start/stop in this file

// put the key press needed into each notelane (pass into constructor for a noteLane)

// try scale the Gameboard to size instead of hardcoding values

// will need to modify: gameBoard and noteLanes

// creating an empty file for now
// for these written notes and to help with potential merge conflicts

// hopefully I'll (Andrew) be able to get some time to work on this
